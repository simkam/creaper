# Governance

## Stewardship

This project is developed and released by Red Hat with assistance from
the Java developer community. The project lead is appointed by Red Hat
and has the power to accept and reject contributions to the project and
set the roadmap. Red Hat employees assigned to work on Creaper as well
as community contributors, in this regard, all answer to the project lead.

## Requirement Definition

The requirements and roadmap for Creaper are driven by Red Hat and
by the community. Typically, when a release is being planned,
the project lead will take input from both Red Hat and the community,
and evaluate what can be done in the necessary time. This will define
what features will be addressed in a given release. The project lead
will then publish the roadmap in GitHub Issues.

The best way for you to suggest requirements for a future release is to enter
a feature request in GitHub Issues. Lobbying for features using the `+1`
comments in GitHub Issues is a great way to express interest as well.
Although, contributing is the single most expedient way to get a capability
into a particular release.

## Releasing

Creaper aims to deliver a major or minor release each month or two months,
although there is typically no schedule. Micro (bugfix) releases are produced
as required.

Creaper follows [Semantic Versioning 2.0.0](http://semver.org/spec/v2.0.0.html)
(aka _SemVer_) for versioning and also as a compatibility promise.

Git tags use the tagging specification from [Semantic Versioning 1.0.0](http://semver.org/spec/v1.0.0.html)
(aka _SemVerTag_).

## Contribution

Creaper welcomes, thrives on and greatly values community contribution.
Please see `CONTRIBUTING.md` for more information on how to contribute.
